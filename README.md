# Practo_Online_Doctor_Consultation

The Purpose of Online Consultation and appointment system is to automate the existing manual system by the computerized equipment and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their data can be stored for a longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same. The main objective of the project is to build an application program to reduce the manual work of managing the details of Doctor, Appointment, Patient.
The Online Consultation and appointment system provides a platform for various citizens/patients for getting appointments with the selected doctor. Here we propose a system that connects patients to available doctors for online consultation. Our proposed system aims to build an environment where various patients needing doctor help consult doctors, chat with doctors, tell them their issues and discuss remedies. It also consists of a doctors login panel where doctors may login to the system and then see patient requests for consultations. The system then schedules those requests and serves them to doctor one after another. Overall, the system is designed for both patients and doctors, where a patient can book,modify and cancel appointments according to his/her schedule and a doctor can view all the patients allocated and treat them accordingly.
